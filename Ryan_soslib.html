</p><p>Great! This is really good news.
</p><p>And about contactEnergies.txt, that's actually a file that my 
python script produces. I had it print out contact energies to compare 
with the results of a previous simulation that I did.
</p><p>Thanks a lot. And have a happy Thanksgiving.

Ryan,
</p><p>To my amazement, this actually worked the first time! (well, it 
seemed to work anyway - see attached pic).  One (Unix) oddity that I did
 notice is that it creates an output file called:  
soslib\examplesSoslib\cc3d\OscillContactEnergies\contactEnergies.txt
</p><p>(wherever you create the "\", we'll eventually want to make "/" for non-Windows platforms).
</p><p>Anyway, this was a nice Thanksgiving Day surprise (I was expecting turkey&nbsp;:)  -- thanks!

So, from the stuff that I just built, do I just need to copy the /lib dir into a cc3d/soslib dir, or more than /lib?:

</p><p>Hi Randy,
</p><p>I'd be interested to see if you can get this oscillating contact 
energies simulation, that I wrote, to work. You'd have to put the soslib
 stuff, that you just built, into a folder called soslib in the CC3D 
root directory. Then I've got two folders that you'd have to add to the 
soslib stuff.
</p><p>Download the following folder and add it to the soslib folder:
svn://sys-bio.org/SVN/rtroper/CompuCell3D/soslib/pythonClasses
</p><p>Download the following folder and add it to the soslib/examplesSoslib/cc3d folder:
svn://sys-bio.org/SVN/rtroper/CompuCell3D/soslib/examplesSoslib/cc3d/OscillContactEnergies
</p><p>Then, in CC3D, open the following python file: OscillContEnergyScript.py
</p><p>Right now, CC3D doesn't seem to find the binaries for soslib 
(e.g. libsoslib.dylib and its dependencies in the bin folder - also, it 
may or may not find _soslibPy.so in the lib/python folder). I've just 
been copying and pasting whatever binaries I need into the root CC3D 
folder. I asked Maciek (but haven't heard back, yet) if there is some 
batch or script file (such as runScript.bat) where I can add the 
appropriate paths to the binaries. At one point, I did this and it 
didn't seem to work. If you have any insight about this, I'd appreciate 
it.
</p><p>Anyway, if that simulation runs then that's a good sign.

Yes and yes.  Thanks!
</p><p>I guess the next question is - how do we incorporate/test soslib and cc3d?  We have a user awaiting these for OSX 10.6.

Hi Ryan,

</p><p>I have:

</p><p>Hello All,
</p><p>You can download the sources for soslib and sundials 2.3.0 from the following:
(1) svn://sys-bio.org/SVN/rtroper/soslib-source/soslibPy
(2) svn://sys-bio.org/SVN/rtroper/sundials-2.3.0
</p><p>Also, go to the libSBML website and download mac binaries for 
libSBML. I think I linked against libSBML 3.4.0. You could probably link
 to older versions, but not 4.0 or newer. For sundials 2.3.0, there are 
cmake files with the svn download above. I haven't run into problems 
building sundials. So when you've installed libSBML and built sundials 
2.3.0, then you can open up the cmake files for soslib in the cmake user
 interface. Just make sure that you change the default library and 
header paths so that it'll find libSBML, sundials and python.
</p><p>I'm trying to think if there are any important details you need 
to know to build everything. Let me know what questions you have and if 
you run into obstacles.
</p><p>Thanks,
</p><p>Ryan

HI Ryan
</p><p>Could you forward us the latest soslib sources and  dependencies?
 I know there is a specific sundial version that has to be used with 
soslib. If you could send Randy and Benji some info on this that would 
be great
