<pre>from Richard:

Mac 3.6.0 your binary build.

Something else is the matter too.  The OpenMP code, on the Mac at least,
may be waiting for resources, and/or there are load-balancing race
issues.  I am also getting some computational/graphical anomalies when I
increase the number of ThreadsPerVPU.  Shark says it is spending 90% of
its time doing gomp_thread_start under semaphore_wait_signal_trap.

To better compare with your system, I used my MacBook Pro with the
2.66GHz Core i7 processor, and ThreadsPerVPU = 1 and
VirtualProcessingUnits = 2.  It created two gridIds and 4 subgrids each.

When I run only the XML, I think my results at 100MCS would be
approximately:
Secretion Plugin   |    PDE only  | Secretion Plugin with Steppable
860 sec	  |    240 sec   |  850 (steppable has no effect)

Interestingly/Strangely, setting the VPUs (and threads) to 1, the PDE
simulation runs slower, as expected, but the Plugin/Steppable simulation
runs faster.  So more threads helps the PDE, as seen previously, but
more threads impede the Plugin/Steppable.  More absolute time, same
ratio as Maciek.  Is this absolute difference due to 64-bit vs 32-bit?
Mac vs Windows?
PDE only   |   Secretion Plugin with Steppable
385 sec    |   505 sec

Setting ThreadPerVPU to 4 and VPUs to 2, 8 gridIds are created.  Same
inverse, but non-linear trend.
PDE only   |   Secretion Plugin with Steppable
188 sec    |   1055 sec (est.)

With 64 threads: 3000 sec.

Therefore, If I am going to loose the advantage of OpenMP with the
Secretion Plugin (allowing me to start/stop secretions per cell), my
eventual simulations will take many days to run.
