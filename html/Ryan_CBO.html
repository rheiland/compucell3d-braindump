</p><p>Hi Randy,
</p><p>Initially it was just Maciek, Herbert and me. There was a fair amount of discussion (interspersed with a fair amount of joking - something about Python causing the extinction of the dinosaurs...) about whether to try creating a scripting language or to just create a Python API for multiscale model specification. Herbert seemed more inclined toward a scripting language, while Maciek suggested the Python API.
</p><p>If I remember correctly, there wasn't a lot of discussion about the document I sent until James got there. Overall, he indicated that it was along the same lines as his own thinking. As for criticisms, I remember the following:
</p><p>1) James envisions it being more hierarchical, similar to the way Abbas presented his tumor model description at the Biocomplexity/CBO conference. I said that I'd go back and look at this again (the presentation and the xmind file) to get a better idea of what he's talking about.
</p><p>2) James commented on the surfaceAreaConstraint command that I included in the sample script in section 3.1.1, noting that this is more of a cc3d-specific concept that may or may not be represented in other modeling/simulation approaches. He suggested avoiding this and replacing it with more general concepts (such as elasticity).
</p><p>Interestingly (for me, at least), James focused more on section 2, which I hadn't necessarily included for the purpose of our conference call. But it emphasized to me that, in devising a multiscale model description language, we should be focused on constructing it from the basis of a sound hierarchical ontology or taxonomy (hence the CBO) - something that Dan Cook also emphasized to me recently. We had a discussion on how, if we follow a hierarchical organization for the language, it will better accommodate a wider variety of modeling/simulation approaches of varying granularity. If a particular modeling/simulation approach does not explicitly treat a concept specified in a model description, a program or application implementing that model can go to a higher level of granularity (present in the model description language), implement the higher-level concept and still get a working simulation.
</p><p>So that was my take on things. There may be details I left out (like James' discourse on sponges and the ambiguity of the concept of 'individual'...and how that relates to ambiguities in the concept of 'adhesion'...), but that's the gist of what I remember. Perhaps Maciek can fill in some other details as he remembers them. I'll let you know if I remember any other important points.
</p><p>Let me know if you have any other questions or if you have any general thoughts/opinions on this stuff. Also, thanks for your help in getting a working mac version of cc3d and soslib for Vivi - very helpful.
</p><p>Thanks,
</p><p>Ryan
