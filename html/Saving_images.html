<p>In an email discussion that started with Yi (at LANL), asking about 
the functionality of the 'camera' icon in the CC3D GUI, I learned some 
things.  Further discussions with Mitja and Julio led to further 
understanding and the discovery of bugs in the functionality.
</p><p>For starters, the function of the 'camera' icon in the toolbar of
 a Graphics Window does *not* mean to simply take a snapshot of what's 
in the graphics window.  What it does do is "remember" the current field
 and orientation that is displayed and dump images using that info.
