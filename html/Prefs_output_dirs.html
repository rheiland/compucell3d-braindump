<pre>The "trivial" change that happened to the Preferences:Output panel was the addition of the "=Project" toggle.
This allows having the output go to the same directory as the "Project Location".
But during the course of this change, I also eliminated the previous behavior of *always* having an (empty)
output dir created, even if the user had not toggled on either image or lattice output.

---------------------
Test cases:

With a single window (the Main Graphics Window):
With "=Project" (lower-right) toggled off:
1) toggle off both image and lattice; step/run sim and verify no output created (not even an empty dir)
2) toggle on just image; Step a few times; verify output created (assuming N small enough); 
   NOTE #1: output directory will take on a unique time-stamped name: &lt;sim prefix&gt;_mm_dd_yyyy_hh_mm_ss
   NOTE #2: an empty /LatticeData subdirectory will also be created
   toggle on lattice also; step a few times; verify lattice output (.vtk files) created
3) without stopping the sim or loading a new one, toggle off both image/lattice; step/run awhile; toggle back on
   image and/or lattice; step/run; verify output is only created when toggles are on
4) repeat 3) and, after a few steps, change the output directory (e.g. append a "2" to CC3DWorkspace)
5) repeat 4), toggling off/on image and lattice
5) stop sim/start new sim; verify new output dir created

With "=Project" toggled on:
repeat above and verify output is created in the "Project Location"


NOTE: if you "Open" a sim, e.g. in the Demos/cellsort_2D subdir, but leave the "Project Location" = .../Demos,
then the output dir is created under /Demos, NOT under /Demos/cellsort_2D


Verify you haven't caused problems with runScript, dumping to a custom dir, e.g.:
runScript.sh -i cellsort_2D.xml -o /Users/heiland/CC3DWorkspace_custom


With multiple graphics windows, where you have clicked the 'camera' icon (upper-right) of the "Aux" window(s)
to signal that images should be saved (note that only images are saved, not lattice):
-- repeat all of above

Test File-&gt;Open Lattice Description Summary File... make sure it opens to the proper dir (depending on the
Output "=Project" toggle)


While dancing on your left foot, typing only with your right hand... (insanity sets in)
