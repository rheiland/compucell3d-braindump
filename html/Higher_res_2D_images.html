				<h1 class="firstHeading">Higher res 2D images</h1>
			<p>Vidhya had a situation where she was running a parameter sweep 
Python script that started up (and killed when finished) the Player for 
each set of parameters and she wanted to have higher resolution png's 
saved.  This amounted to manually tweaking 
player/Utilities/QVTKRenderWindowInteractor[_mac].py:
</p>
<pre>    def sizeHint(self):
#        return QtCore.QSize(400, 400)
        return QtCore.QSize(800, 800)  # whatever default resolution is desired
</pre>
<p>This led to providing a "-w WidthxHeight" on the compucell3d.sh command line to specify the size of the graphics window.
