				<h1 class="firstHeading">TST</h1>
			<p>In an attempt to answer the question, "how fast/slow is CC3D; how 
does it compare to similar tools?", we must first find a "similar tool" 
with which to compare.  One such tool is the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=120368" class="external text" title="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=120368" rel="nofollow">TST</a>
 (Tissue Simulation Toolkit).  After downloading and installing TST, we 
begin to appreciate some of the difficulties in trying to compare CC3D 
and TST.  Both C++, but ...; graphics; extensibility; interactivity.
</p><p>After successfully building TST, one can run:
</p>
<pre>sorting sorting.par
</pre>
<p>where <i>sorting.par</i> contains all necessary parameters (Cellular 
Potts, PDE, initial conditions, output) for a simulation.  One such 
Cellular Potts parameter, Jtable, is a file name which contains 
additional parameters.  The following images show snapshots resulting 
from runs using the provided files, <i>Jpepperandsalt.dat, Jsorting.dat, Jnoadhesion.dat</i>, respectively.
