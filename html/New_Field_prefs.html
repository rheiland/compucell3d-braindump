Colormap | Cell Type | Vectors | 3D.  As you can see, we have now 
combined 'Colormap' and 'Vectors' into the single 'Field' tab.  In this 
new tab, there is a 'Field name' combobox that will contain the names of
 all fields defined in the simulation.  (Note, however, that this 
combobox will not be filled in until the user begins the simulation (via
 Step or Run)).  This will allow for field-specific parameters.  Note 
that the "Vector Arrows" block applies only to vector fields and the 
"Scalar Contours" applies only to scalar fields; however, neither one is
 disabled when it does not apply.

<p>Comments/ToDo...
</p>
<li> Are there any issues with trying to use an existing (old-style) QSettings file?
</li><li> Might be good to warn user to 'Apply' when selecting a different field (in combobox)
</li><li> For a vector field, it's not possible to have fixed-length arrows
</li><li> For a vector field, it's confusing to have 'Fixed arrow color' checked AND to Show a legend
</li><li> Contour color (and other Additional colors) in Cell Type tab belong in Field tab
</li><li> Want to avoid doing a getSetting for each Step/re-draw (should update attributes when Prefs updated)
</li><li> For a vector field, 'Overlay Vector and Cell Field' does not work for 3D vis of cells
</li><li> Might be nice if the Field tab remembered/displayed the last selected field (in the combobox)
</li><li> If there are no fields defined, would be better to disable entire Field tab
</li><li> Possible problems if sim #2 has same fieldnames as sim #1 and using same Prefs (QSettings) file; best to use unique
Prefs files for each sim
</li><li> Why do we display the Min/Max values at the bottom of the 
Player (next to the MCS #)?  When displaying multiple fields, what field
 does it even apply to?
