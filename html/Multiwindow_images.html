			<p>Michael reported a bug with trying to save images (on OSX) from multiple fields and getting distorted (striated) images.

<p>In player/Graphics/MVCDrawView2D.py (or 3D), I believe you can change
 the magnification amount from 1 to something larger in takeSimShot(), 
e.g.:
</p>
<pre>        renderLarge = vtk.vtkRenderLargeImage()
        renderLarge.SetInput(self.graphicsFrameWidget.ren)
        renderLarge.SetMagnification(2)
</pre>
<p>and it should capture magnified .png images (but not with degraded 
image quality).  I just tested on my Mac and it seemed to work.  
Unfortunately, this is not yet a parameter accessible from the GUI, nor 
can you provide non-integer magnification factors (at least that was my 
experience), nor can you specify different aspect ratios for the window 
size.  Although, as we discussed via email back in April, I believe you 
could also experiment with the basic window size (and hence, aspect 
ratio) via  player/Utilities/QVTKRenderWindowInteractor{_mac}.py:  
sizeHint()

Hey Randy, 
</p><p>I've got most of it working now, but I have one error left that 
it pretty problematic. When I run the simulation and click the take 
snapshot button, everytime it tries to output a new image of the field, 
it screws up the screen while outputting the image, gives an error of 
unable to draw, and outputs the image in the original format that the 
player opens in instead of the larger format. I can live with the 
problem of the screen screwup. Though annoying it doesn't mess up the 
screenshot, however, I need to be able to resize the windows for a 
larger output format to be able to see higher resolution images.

<pre>July 2011:
When outputting images using our mac server, if I run multiple simulations (I'll usually run 10), and 
if I am outputting images from several different gradients (FGF, BMP, etc), by using the "Take 
Screenshot" Button and allowing it to output at the defined intervals, then it will output very 
distorted images.They simply look like striations of color and are completely unrecognizable as 
anything. If I do the same thing on a windows system (for CPU limits I only run up to 4), I don't get 
any distortion. This is not model specific, it is entirely within the player, so any use case model 
can work

<p>Note that our technique for saving images of Aux windows (i.e. when 
user clicks the camera icon in the graphics window) is less than ideal -
 creating an additional ("phantom") window - on Linux and OSX.

<pre>NOTE:  for 3D sims, when a 2D slice in being displayed in an Aux window, the user MUST re-click
the camera icon if the slice # has been changed.  This will result in an appropriately named
output directory for the saved images, e.g.:
heiland@Macintosh-91:~/CC3DWorkspace/diffusion_fast_box_3D_xml_07_28_2011_10_00_45$ ls
FGF_ConField_2D_XY_24/        diffusion_fast_box_3D_xml_00014.png  diffusion_fast_box_3D_xml_00031.png
FGF_ConField_2D_XY_27/        diffusion_fast_box_3D_xml_00015.png  diffusion_fast_box_3D_xml_00032.png
