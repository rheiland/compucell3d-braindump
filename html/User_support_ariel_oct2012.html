What about running with a single thread:
SkinMattekNutrientShrink.py:#    metadata.ElementCC3D("VirtualProcessingUnits",{"ThreadsPerVPU":2},4)
SkinMattekNutrientShrink.py:    metadata.ElementCC3D("VirtualProcessingUnits",{"ThreadsPerVPU":1},1)
</pre>
<pre>OK, I've spent too much time on your "bug" of not being to use runScript.  The basic problem stems from the voodoo you're trying 
to do in this function in MattekMasterSteppableNutrientShrink.py:

def writeFileToScreenshotOutputDirectory(CompuCellSetup, files_to_write=[]):

    screenshotDirectoryName = CompuCellSetup.getScreenshotDirectoryName()
    if screenshotDirectoryName is not "":
        print("screenshotDirectoryName", screenshotDirectoryName)

        screenshot_directory_parts = screenshotDirectoryName.split("/")
        parent = "/".join(screenshot_directory_parts[:-1])

        caller_file_name = inspect.stack()[1][1]
        caller_file_name = os.path.abspath(caller_file_name)
        print("caller file name", caller_file_name)

        shutil.copy2(caller_file_name, screenshotDirectoryName)
        shutil.copy2(CompuCellSetup.simulationPythonScriptName, screenshotDirectoryName)

        for file_name in files_to_write:
            shutil.copy2(parent + "/" + file_name, screenshotDirectoryName)

--------------------------

What's happening is that this copies/creates a *file*, not a *directory* called, e.g.:

~/CC3DWorkspace$ ll|grep skin
-rw-r--r--     1 heiland  staff   18041 Oct  3 10:48 SkinMattekNutrientShrink_py_10_03_2012_11_14_35


and then, later, in cc3d, when we try to create the /LatticeData subdir at this dir, it realizes that it's not a 
dir after all, but a file and croaks with an error:
"â€¦./pythonSetupScripts/CMLFieldHandler.py", line 132, in prepareSimulationStorageDir
    makedirs(_dirName)


----------------------
Here's a tweaked function of the one above to at least show you that a file is being created instead of a dir and 
I'll leave it to you to figure out a proper fix:

def writeFileToScreenshotOutputDirectory(CompuCellSetup, files_to_write=[]):

    screenshotDirectoryName = CompuCellSetup.getScreenshotDirectoryName()
    if screenshotDirectoryName is not "":
        print("screenshotDirectoryName", screenshotDirectoryName)

        screenshot_directory_parts = screenshotDirectoryName.split("/")
        parent = "/".join(screenshot_directory_parts[:-1])

        caller_file_name = inspect.stack()[1][1]
        caller_file_name = os.path.abspath(caller_file_name)
        print("caller file name", caller_file_name)

        print ("MattekMasterSteppableNutrientShrink.py: writeFileToScreenshotOutputDirectory():  caller_file name=", caller_file_name)
        print ("MattekMasterSteppableNutrientShrink.py: writeFileToScreenshotOutputDirectory():  screenshotDirectoryName=",screenshotDirectoryName )
        if not os.path.isdir(screenshotDirectoryName):
           print ("MattekMasterSteppableNutrientShrink.py: writeFileToScreenshotOutputDirectory():  screenshotDirectoryName is NOT a dir!!!!!!!!!!!!")
#           os.makedirs(dest_path)   # might try to use this to make it a dir
        shutil.copy2(caller_file_name, screenshotDirectoryName)
        shutil.copy2(CompuCellSetup.simulationPythonScriptName, screenshotDirectoryName)

        for file_name in files_to_write:
            file2copy = parent + "/" + file_name
            print ("MattekMasterSteppableNutrientShrink.py: writeFileToScreenshotOutputDirectory():  file2copy=",file2copy)           
            shutil.copy2(file2copy, screenshotDirectoryName)

Ok.  Thanks.

No, when I tried a couple of options, it didn't work for me either.  Will try to tackle it again tomorrow probably.

Ok.  But if I want to run on a cluster, I still need to use the no gui option.  I just tried putting my simulation files 
directly in the install directory.  Still no luck.  

Does it work for you?

No.  Bad assumption.  Just set your screen image update very high.

Any progress on the run script (no gui) thing?  I'm assuming that it would be much faster without the gui.

Thanks, Ari

How should this be run and what should I see as output?  When I open/run:  SkinMattekNutrientShrink.py
I get as output:

But nothing seems to appear in the player.  Single stepping more than once or twice seems to have it hang forever - or is 
this an incredibly lengthy computation?

Hi folks.  I'm running cc3d on two different machines.  On the machine I've been using it runs fine.  On the new machine 
it is crashing after a while.  Here is the error.  Does this mean anything to you?  It was installed on a 64 bit machine using 
the .deb.

I'm using periodic BC.  Would that matter?

Thanks, Ariel
