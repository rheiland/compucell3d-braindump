Today is the first day I have had a request for the batch version.  I
will try it out and let you know either way.  Thanks.  We are all

Hi Richard,

Just curious if you ever had a chance to try out the script that I
sent
- for rendering 2D hex cells?  In addition to testing with the 2D
cellsort demo, I also tried it with one of Michael's datasets from the
summer workshop and it seemed to render fine.  However, as I recall,
you
were also wanting to do zooming on the image - is that correct?

Randy, Maciek

Summarizing below.  The data extractor does not exist or do the hex
transformation like the border function already does.  The lack of
this
capability or time to implement ourselves prevents us from completing
our automated end-to-end batch job.

Thanks

Yes, I found the documentation after I sent my message.  But does
that
mean I have to reapply the formulas manually in my script after I
read
the data, as Michael does in his simulation?  Or is there a reader
that
does what self.fieldExtractor.fillBorderData2DHex seems to do?  If I
am
even a little different in my calculations, that may amplify the
adjustments I already have to do to get them to register assuming a
square matrix.  I still wonder why the adjustments are necessary,
and/or
how the GUI does, or avoids doing, so.  Thanks.

This is true

Hex lattice is stored as regular square lattice and then if we read it
in it is being transformed into hex lattice for drawing purposes bu the
base structure for the two lattices is 3D or 2D array. The formulas for
transforming square coordinates to hex coordinates are in the CC3D manual

(See attached file: Mouse_Limb_Model_mysql_test_File1X.py)

If I use the self.fieldExtractor.fillBorderData2DHex extractor instead,
I get the following image.  Notice that the cells now look more like the

Subject:    GUI scales Data?: Fwd: [Fwd: Update/Registration:
Turning on cell borders in batch (runScript) mode?]


In fact, when I compare the images from the GUI (Initializer...)
with
mine from the script (CellType...), it appears that the GUI is
actually
increasing the size of the compute grid by scaling the data, not
just
the camera or render view.  If you zoom into the GUI image and
compare
it to the script image, the GUI image cells are rounder and the
borders
are jaggier, than the more square and course script version.  This
was
one of my original questions.  Is the GUI scaling the grid data and
is
that higher resolution cell data (image or structured points) being
passed to the Border actor?  Of course, this would not make sense
in
batch mode unless I scale the grid data before running the
simulation,
which I am going to do with a different method, eventually, for
data
quality reasons, not image quality reasons.  If you can confirm
this
observation, that will explain some of the differences.  Then, If
you
can point me to the routine that scales the data, I may have to do
the
same thing in batch mode.  But, scaling up would slow the
simulation
and
complicate my Xgrid transmission limit problems.

Subject:    Re: Fwd: [Fwd: Update/Registration: Turning on cell
borders in batch (runScript) mode?]


OK.  I am just trying to achieve with what my script should do and what
the GUI accomplishes magically (maciekally/heilandally).
* Namely, zoom a grid, in this case (400X518) to something larger (in
this example 800X1016) and draw the borders of linewidth 1.0 (default,
always) with the cell type colors and the borders being registered properly.

Questions:
1) What is the real reason for the observations, and how does the GUI
avoid or hide the problem?  Can the script do the same thing the GUI
does?
2) BTW.  If you run this script on a Mac, you'll notice that the
rendering occurs in the background, but a window still pops up.
Since I can't force this into a virtual frame buffer on the Mac, this
single problem prevents me from running the script in batch mode on our
Xgrid.
Presumably it will work on Linux.  Any Mac VTK suggestions you can
give me there would be much appreciated.  Of course, I tried all of the
workarounds I could find on the web.  But is there a way to point
the RenderWindow to the virtual frame buffer?

Thanks

Hi Richard,

Maciek fwded your email to me and here's at least some initial
feedback
- assuming you haven't already figured out some solutions.  First,
the
reason that the script was rendering such "thick" border lines was
because of the renWin.SetSize(--).  I guess you were using the
actual
size of the lattice - or something close to that?  If you simply
increase the rendering window resolution, e.g. (512,512) then the
default mapper on the border lines (1 pixel) will be more
meaningful.
I
actually preferred the following, but whatever:
bactor.GetProperty().SetLineWidth(2.0)

The other problem of mis-registration between cell borders and
pixels
most likely has to do with the quirky thing in cc3D to add an extra
space to the lattice (I don't claim to thoroughly understand the
reasons
behind it).  However, to at least partially solve this problem in
your
script, I found that inserting the following helped (at least with
my
simple test case):
bactor.SetPosition(0.0,-1.0,0.0)

I plan to eventually  post a page related to this on my wiki brain
dump
and will send a link when I do.  I've also attached your script
with
my
tweaks (search for 'rwh').

  Maciek

  I got a script to work, mostly last week, but there are
  registration
  problems between the cell image and the borders image,
especially
  if I
  zoom both.

  Michael runs at a relatively smaller grid dimension and then
  typically
  zooms larger in the GUI.  See the attached image from the GUI.

  (See attached file: GUI_Snapshot.png)

  When I run my script with no zoom (commented out), at the native
  1:1
  resolution, I get the following, which is mostly OK but may have
  problems.  This is too coarse if the image itself is zoomed,
  because the
  border lines are too thick relatively.

  (See attached file: CellType_ccmm025.png)(See attached file:
  ccvtkpngborders.py)

  If I zoom the rendering with vtkActor.SetScale, you can see from
  the
  resulting image that the cell image and borders are not
registered
  or
  the mapping differs significantly, perhaps because the borders
are
  computed at the non-zoom resolution.

  (See attached file: CellType_ccmm004.png)(See attached file:
  ccvtkpngborderszoom.py)

  If I use a Fudge Factor (see code) with vtkActor.SetOrigin, I
can
  improve but not perfect the registration.

  Questions:
  I looked at the code thoroughly, but could not find out how the
  cell map
  and border map use the same data.  How would I do it in this
  script?  I
  tried to vtkTransformFilter the data for both, but that did not
  work.

  Any more suggestions or clues would be appreciated.

  Thanks

  Richard

  I have put together script which still needs some work but is
  closer
  to what you want. I have included some comments in the script to
  point
  you to files where you may find more answers in case you run
into
  problems.
  essentially all you will be doing is
  1) read VTK file (using vtkStructuredPointsReader)
  2) store vtkFile outpur in the vtkStructuredPoints
  3) set fieldextractor lattice dimenstion using Dim3D CC3D class
-
  part
  of CompuCell Python module
  4) get c++ pointer of vtkStructuredPoints and pass it to field
  extractor
  5) extract borders

  Also, you need to run this script from .sh file where you set
all
  the
  environment variables you use in CC3D run script. This is to
make
  sure
  CompuCell, PlayerPython etc scripts are found correctly

  let me know if this helps.

  I have to run now but I will be e-mailable next week

        This is the function that draws borders - file
        player/GraphicsMVCDrawModel2D.py. fillBorderData2D is
        actually
        implemented in C++ and is a party of FieldExtractor which
        reads VTK
        file and initializes VTK data structures that are then use
        to
        construct border actor.

           def initBordersActors2D(self,_actors):
               points = vtk.vtkPoints()
               lines = vtk.vtkCellArray()
               pointsIntAddr=self.extractAddressIntFromVtkObject
        (points)
               linesIntAddr=self.extractAddressIntFromVtkObject
        (lines)

               self.parentWidget.fieldExtractor.fillBorderData2D
        (pointsIntAddr
        , linesIntAddr, self.currentDrawingParameters.plane,
        self.currentDrawingParameters.planePos)

               borders = vtk.vtkPolyData()

               borders.SetPoints(points)
               borders.SetLines(lines)

               self.borderMapper.SetInput(borders)
               _actors[0].SetMapper(self.borderMapper)


        The field extractor is initialized in
        player/Plugins/ViewManagerPlugins/SimpleTabView.py

               if  CompuCellSetup.playerType=="CMLResultReplay":
                   self.__viewManagerType="CMLResultReplay"

                   self.simulation=CMLResultReader(self)

                   # print "GOT THIS
        self.__fileName=",self.__fileName
                   self.simulation.extractLatticeDescriptionInfo
        (self.__fileName)
                   #filling out basic simulation data

        self.basicSimulationData.fieldDim=self.simulation.fieldDim


self.basicSimulationData.numberOfSteps=self.simulation.numberOfSteps


                   self.connect(self.simulation,SIGNAL
        ("simulationInitialized
        (bool)"),self.initializeSimulationViewWidget)
                   self.connect(self.simulation,SIGNAL
        ("simulationFinished

                   self.connect(self.simulation,SIGNAL

                   # print "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

        self.simulation=",self.simulation
                   import PlayerPython


        self.fieldExtractor=PlayerPython.FieldExtractorCML()
                   self.fieldExtractor.setFieldDim
        (self.basicSimulationData.fieldDim)

        There are two types of fieldExtractors - one which works
on
        "live
        lattice" and one called FieldextractorCML (CML stands for
        CoMmand
        Line) which works on vtk files and you are interested in
the
        later.

        so in your script all you need to do is the following:

           def initBordersActors2DCustomScript(self,_actors):
               import PlayerPython
               self.fieldExtractor=PlayerPython.FieldExtractorCML
()
               self.fieldExtractor.setFieldDim(fieldDim)

               points = vtk.vtkPoints()
               lines = vtk.vtkCellArray()
               pointsIntAddr=self.extractAddressIntFromVtkObject
        (points)
               linesIntAddr=self.extractAddressIntFromVtkObject
        (lines)

               fieldExtractor.fillBorderData2D(pointsIntAddr ,
        linesIntAddr,
        self.currentDrawingParameters.plane,
        self.currentDrawingParameters.planePos)

               borders = vtk.vtkPolyData()

               borders.SetPoints(points)
               borders.SetLines(lines)

               self.borderMapper.SetInput(borders)
               _actors[0].SetMapper(self.borderMapper)

               ......

              ffmpeg) in a
        batch
              process on an Xgrid and on a very large Linux
cluster.

              Question: Is there a way to force CC3D to write the
              borders into the
        VTK
              file data in batch mode?  It looks to me from the
code
              as if only the
              GUI can draw bordrers.  If not, I may have to
              duplicate that feature
        in
              a script/program.  Suggestions/Warnings?

              Thanks

              Richard
