<p>This page tries to provide a bit of insight into using CMake for building CompuCell3D from source.  CMake is a platform-independent build system.
</p><p>Obviously, the first thing needed is the (open source) <a href="http://www.cmake.org" class="external text" title="http://www.cmake.org" rel="nofollow">cmake</a> package installed on your computer.  Once this is done, you should have access to two executables: <b>cmake</b> and <b>ccmake</b>.  The former is the "manual" way of running CMake; the latter is the Curses interface for CMake.  Regardless of which one you use, the typical approach to using cmake is:
</p>
<pre>
  cmake &lt;path-to-source&gt;

and thereafter:
  cmake &lt;path-to-existing-build&gt;
</pre>
<p>One straightforward way to try to build CompuCell3D is:
</p>
<ul><li> download the source from svn
</li><li> run 'cmake .' in the root directory of the source
</li><li> edit the generated CMakeCache.txt file and change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to point to a local dir
</li><li> re-run 'cmake .' and 'make'
</li></ul>
<p>It is also assumed that you have installed all dependencies for CompuCell3, e.g. Qt and VTK, and that your [shell] environment is setup to point to these packages (including the location of the shared libs and whatever your env var is for that).  E.g. I have VTK_DIR and QTDIR env vars pointing to the roots of those builds.
</p><p>CMake uses a FIND_PACKAGE command to locate various packages that may be needed for a project, e.g.:
</p>
<pre>
player/CMakeLists.txt:FIND_PACKAGE(VTK REQUIRED)
</pre>
