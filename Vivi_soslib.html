</p><p>Hi Randy,
</p><p>This first binary you sent today is working perfectly!
And SOSlib is also working well. I'm very glad after so many attempts to get it running before. 
Thank you so much for your help compiling/building all this stuff. 
</p><p>BUTâ€¦.
for the latest installer, there are some problems. I attach 2 jpeg files of errors that occurred at the end of installation. And I can't run it either. I don't see compucell3d.command file in the main directory, there are only compucell3d.sh.in and runScript.sh.in files.
